Note:  Initial Codes - This section contains the initial attempts where you might have encountered issues or problems. 
Final Codes - This section contains the improved and corrected version of the code. Specify how each issue identified in the initial codes was resolved.

The final three code snippets constitute the successful ultimate code. 
Purpose:

This code extracts author names and the titles of their first books from a Wikipedia page.
It utilizes the requests library to fetch the HTML content and BeautifulSoup for parsing and navigating the HTML.
Functionality:

The script fetches a Wikipedia page containing a list of authors.
It uses BeautifulSoup to find links (<a> tags) and displays author names whose titles start with a specified letter.
For each author, it queries the Open Library API to retrieve details about their first book.

2. Code using Selenium:
Purpose:
This code demonstrates the use of Selenium to automate browser interactions for web scraping.
It opens the Wikipedia page, locates links with a specified starting letter, and displays author names.
Functionality:
The script uses a Firefox WebDriver with Selenium to automate browser actions.
It finds links (<a> tags) on the Wikipedia page, filters them based on the starting letter, and displays the author names.
Similar to the first code, it queries the Open Library API for details about each author's first book.

4. Code using BeautifulSoup with Delay:
Purpose:

This code is a variant of the first one, introducing a delay using time.sleep() after fetching HTML content.
The delay helps avoid potential issues with web scraping, such as being blocked by the website.
Functionality:

The script fetches the Wikipedia page, parses HTML using BeautifulSoup, and finds links.
It displays author names with a specified starting letter and introduces a delay before quitting to enhance reliability.
Example Usage:
All three codes provide an example usage for authors whose names start with "Sh" on the Wikipedia page.
Dependencies:
The scripts require the requests, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium libraries. Install them using:
bash

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 selenium
Note:
Ensure you have the appropriate WebDriver (e.g., geckodriver for Firefox) and specify the correct path if needed.




Here's a concise explanation for the three codes:

Code 1: Extracting Authors and Their First Books from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup and Open Library API
Purpose:
Extracts author names starting with a specified letter from a Wikipedia page.
Uses BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and requests for fetching web content.
Queries the Open Library API to find the first book of each author.
Code 2: Extracting Authors and Their First Books from Wikipedia using Selenium and Open Library API
Purpose:
Achieves the same objective as Code 1 but using Selenium for dynamic content.
Selenium controls a headless Firefox browser to interact with the Wikipedia page.
Also queries the Open Library API for each author's first book.
Code 3: Extracting Authors and Their First Books from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup, Open Library API, and Time Delay
Purpose:
Similar to Code 1 but uses a time delay with time.sleep(5) to avoid rapid requests.
Implements a delay to ensure smooth execution without overwhelming the server.
The delay is incorporated with BeautifulSoup and Open Library API for consistency.
