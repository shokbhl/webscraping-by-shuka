BBC News Scraper App
Overview
This Python application allows users to scrape BBC News topics, navigate through selected pages, and search for specific statements within the context of those pages. The primary goal is to verify the legitimacy of news statements.

Features
Topic Selection: Choose from a list of available news topics.
Page Navigation: Navigate through pages related to the selected topic.
Statement Verification: Enter a statement to check for its presence in the scraped data.
Context Matching: Utilizes fuzzy string matching to identify contexts similar to the entered statement.
Link Extraction: Displays hyperlinks of matching contexts to access related news pages.
Technical Skills
Web Scraping: Utilizes the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to extract data from BBC News pages.
Fuzzy String Matching: Integrates the fuzzywuzzy library to compare statements with scraped data.
User Interaction: Prompts users to make selections, input statements, and provides feedback.
HTML Parsing: Extracts relevant information by parsing HTML structure.
Error Handling: Addresses potential errors, such as invalid user input or failed web requests.
Architecture
Application Structure
The application follows a modular structure with distinct functions for various tasks:

get_bbc_news_topics(): Fetches the available news topics from the BBC News homepage.
scrape_with_classes(soup, classes): Scrapes data from the HTML soup using specified classes.
compare_statement(statement, scraped_data): Compares user-entered statements with scraped data and returns matching contexts.
Flow of Execution
Topic Selection: Users choose a news topic, triggering the retrieval of available topics.
Page Navigation: The selected topic leads to the scraping of related pages, displaying available options to the user.
Statement Verification: Users enter a statement, initiating a comparison with scraped data.
Context Matching: Fuzzy string matching identifies contexts with high similarity to the entered statement.
Link Extraction: Extracts hyperlinks of matching contexts for further exploration.
Usage
Run the script (bbc_news_scraper.py) in a Python environment.
Choose a news topic from the provided list.
Navigate through pages related to the selected topic.
Enter a statement for verification.
Review matching contexts and associated hyperlinks.

Code Evolution
Initial Exploration
The initial sections of the code are dedicated to exploratory practices. Different functions and approaches are tested to understand the structure of the BBC News website and how to extract relevant information. These initial snippets serve as a foundation for developing the final, more sophisticated version.

Ultimate Code
The final and ultimate code, found in the last part of the script, brings together all the insights gained during the exploration phase. Let's break down the important parts:

1. Topic Retrieval (get_bbc_news_topics()):
python
topics = get_bbc_news_topics()
This function fetches the available news topics from the BBC News homepage. It locates the 'News' section, extracts the associated topic list, and presents it to the user for selection.

2. Page Navigation and Scraping:
python

topic_url = f'https://www.bbc.com{selected_topic[2]}'
topic_response = requests.get(topic_url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(topic_response.text, 'html.parser')
These lines make a request to the selected topic's page, retrieve the HTML content, and parse it using BeautifulSoup. This sets the stage for further analysis and extraction of relevant information.

3. Scraping with Specified Classes (scrape_with_classes()):
python

scraped_data = scrape_with_classes(soup, classes_to_check)
This function takes the parsed HTML soup and specific class names to extract relevant data from the page. The classes (classes_to_check) are carefully selected to capture meaningful information related to the news.

4. Statement Verification (compare_statement()):
python
matched_data = compare_statement(user_statement, scraped_data)
The user enters a statement, and this function compares it with the scraped data. It utilizes fuzzy string matching to find contexts with a high similarity to the entered statement.

5. Matching Context Display:
python
 
if matched_data:
    print("Matching contexts found:")
    for link, data in matched_data:
        print(f"Link: {link} - Matched: {data}")
else:
    print("No matching context found. The statement might not be legitimate.")
If matching contexts are found, the script displays them with associated hyperlinks. If no matching context is found, it provides a user-friendly message.

User Interaction and Error Handling
The code incorporates user interaction through prompts for topic selection and statement entry. Error handling mechanisms are in place to address potential issues, such as invalid user input or failed web requests.

Technical Skills and Dependencies
The README section details the technical skills applied, including web scraping, fuzzy string matching, HTML parsing, and user interaction. Dependencies such as requests, BeautifulSoup, and fuzzywuzzy are highlighted for users to install before running the script.
